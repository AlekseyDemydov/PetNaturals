        Car rides. Vet visits. Thunderstorms. Boarding. Parties. These are just
        a handful of times when Calming chews may come in handy. Does your dog
        hate to be left home alone? Does your cat love hiding under the bed?
        Serve up a Calming chew to help soothe your furry pal’s anxiety and make
        your life easier, too!

      <p class="yeText">For Best Results:</p>
      <p class="yeText">
        We recommend administering Calming chews 30 minutes prior to a stressful
        event. The 30-minute activation period gives you a chance to increase
        dosage if you’re not seeing expected results. Calming is safe for unique
        stress inducing events and for long-term use to help manage everyday
        stress.
